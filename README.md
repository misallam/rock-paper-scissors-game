# Rock Paper Scissors Interactive Game
Hey and welcome! This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Python programming language to play in your terminal (highly recommended) or even in a simple desktop interface.

# How to Play:
Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).

Open your terminal or your code editor and navigate to the project directory.

# Run the following command to start the game:

$ cd {game_file_path}

$ python main.py

The game will display a prompt asking you to enter your name and gender, then to choose your move, and finally give you a comprehensive report about your time in the game.

# Game Rules:

Rock beats Scissors.

Paper beats Rock.

Scissors beat Paper.

If both players choose the same move, it's a tie.

#### The game will display the result (e.g., "You win!", "Computer wins!", or "It's a tie!").

You can play again by choosing "y", or you can exit the game and get your cool report by typing "n" or "q" for "quit".

Enjoy playing Rock Paper Scissors!
